Description: We implement the basic ideas of energy statistics to solve three kinds of hypothesis test and estimate the empirical powers in some specific examples with comparison to other classical testing method.
    The three hypothesis tests are Energy normality test, Multivariate test for equal distributions based on multi-sample energy statistics, Energy test of Independence based on distance correlation. Some main functions are listed in the package.
